#🎒 High School Grades
#U.S. high schools typically last for four years, from freshman year to senior year. 🚌💨 First, ask the user to enter their grade as an integer.
#Create a four-year high school grade system using an if/elif/else statement:

grade = int(input("What is your grade? "))

if grade == 9:
    print("Freshman")
elif grade == 10:
    print("Sophomore")
elif grade == 11:
    print("Junior")
elif grade == 12:
    print("Senior")
else:
    print("TBD")
