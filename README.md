# learning-python

Update: 04-01-2025
- This is my way learning Python (again).
- It's simple, I had learned Python two years ago but I never practiced with a real project.
- Now, I'm working on CODEDEX game to learn again the syntaxis.
- There are the exercises that I made yesterday and today in CodÃ©dex (https://www.codedex.io/python).
- I have completed "Hello World" & "Variables" chapters.

Update: 05-01-2025
- I have completed the half of the "Control flow" chapter.
- I checked if/else statements and I've learned what is a module and how to import it.

Update: 08-01-2025
- I have completed the exercise #16 from the "Control flow" chapter.
- I checked logical operators: AND, OR and NOT. It's good remember how to use them in Python. I like it!
- Let's update my Github repository!
- Note: I like how looks this emoji in the code editor ðŸŽ¢ haha

Update: 09-01-2025
- I had a review about 'if' statement, relational operators and logical operators coding a program about Harry Potter.
- I read extra info about nested 'if' statements. Note: Nesting these statements too deeply (2-3 levels) isn't good!

Update: 18-01-2025
- I have completed the challenge pack coding the five exercises about control flow.
- It took me around 1 hour. I think I did it good!

Update: 25-01-2025
- I completed all the exercises frome the chapter that were focus on loops as 'while' and 'for'.
- There is one of the most difficult topics when I'm checking again a language. Specially talking about nested loops.
- I read the bonus article. The next step is complete the five challenge pack exercises.
