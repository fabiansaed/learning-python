# learning-python

Update: 04-01-2025
- This is my way learning Python (again).
- It's simple, I had learned Python two years ago but I never practiced with a real project.
- Now, I'm working on CODEDEX game to learn again the syntaxis.
- There are the exercises that I made yesterday and today in Codédex (https://www.codedex.io/python).
- I have completed "Hello World" & "Variables" chapters.

Update: 05-01-2025
- I have completed the half of the "Control flow" chapter.
- I checked if/else statements and I've learned what is a module and how to import it.
